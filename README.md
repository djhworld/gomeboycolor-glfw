gomeboycolor
============================
**This project is a work in progress and is no way near complete!**

Nintendo Gameboy Color emulator, this is my first emulator so I'm learning as I go along...

This repository is the frontend for running the emulator using `libglfw`. The backend that implements the emulator can be found in: [djhworld/gomeboycolor](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor)
